# GodZilo's BackDoor

A python program that open a backdoor to the victom's computer

# How does it work?
The program.py downloading from the internet the backdoor.py file and saves it in the
appdata directory, then it's executing the file. Meanwhile the program.py is letting the user
play a guessing game. The backdoor.py file is connecting every 20 secconds to a *Command And Control Server*

that's running the server.py file.

# How to use?
Open a linux VM arunning the program.py file, the server will get a connection.
From there you can type any command you want (reverse shell), upload or download a file, take
a screenshot, make this backdoor executing any time the computer is on, and a lot more.
Use the help command to show all the data you need to operate the program.
Use the exit OR quit commands to close the server
